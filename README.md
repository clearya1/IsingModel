# Ising Model
Various numerical algorithms to solve the Ising model in 2 and 3D. These algorithms include the Metropolis algorithm, the Prokof'ev and Svistunov single worm algorithm. Also included is a more efficient extension to the Prokof'ev and Svistunov algorithm, which we called the double worm algorithm.
